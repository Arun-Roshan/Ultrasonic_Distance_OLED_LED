# Ultrasonic_Distance_OLED_LED
A complete Arduino Uno project that uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance, displays real-time data with modern animations on a 128x64 OLED display, and triggers an LED alert when the object is too close. This project is ideal for obstacle detection, distance alerts, and beginner IoT demonstrations.
